# anytone-flash-tools
Independend flash tools for Anytone 878UV radios and maybe other anytone models

## Goal
Understand the communication protocol between CPS and radio. Provide open source platform independent reprogramming tools.

## Why?
Because it has to be done. CPS is only available on windows. Device and CPS will be discontinued and stop working some time. Most of the features are only programmable via software and not on the device itself. So there must be a free alternative.

## How?

## AT878UV Protocol

## Available tools so far...
This his highly experimental code. Use it at your owm risk!
